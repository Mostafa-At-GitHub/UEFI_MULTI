Usage:

	bootlace.com  [OPTIONS]  DEVICE_OR_FILE

OPTIONS:

	--read-only		do everything except the actual write to the
				specified DEVICE_OR_FILE.

	--restore-mbr		restore the previous mbr.

	--mbr-no-bpb		do not copy BPB in the boot sector of the
				leading FAT partition to MBR.

	--no-backup-mbr		do not copy the old MBR to the second sector of
				DEVICE_OR_FILE.

	--force-backup-mbr	force the copy of old MBR to the second sector
				of DEVICE_OR_FILE.

	--mbr-enable-floppy	enable the search for GRLDR on floppy.

	--mbr-disable-floppy	disable the search for GRLDR on floppy.

	--mbr-enable-osbr	enable the boot of PREVIOUS MBR with invalid
				partition table(usually an OS boot sector).

	--mbr-disable-osbr	disable the boot of PREVIOUS MBR with invalid
				partition table(usually an OS boot sector).

	--duce			disable the feature of unconditional entrance
	                        to the command-line.

				Normally one can unconditionally get the
				command-line console by a keypress of `C',
				bypassing all config-files(including the
				preset-menu). This is a security hole. So we
				need this option to disable the feature.

				DUCE is for Disable Unconditional Command-line
				Entrance.

	--chs-no-tune		disable the feature of geometry tune.

	--boot-prevmbr-first	try to boot PREVIOUS MBR before the search for
				GRLDR.

	--boot-prevmbr-last	try to boot PREVIOUS MBR after the search for
				GRLDR.

	--preferred-drive=D	preferred boot drive number, 0 <= D < 255.

	--preferred-partition=P	preferred partition number, 0 <= P < 255.

	--serial-number=SN	setup a new serial number for the hard drive.
				SN must be non-zero.

	--time-out=T		wait T seconds before booting PREVIOUS MBR. if
				T is 0xff, wait forever. The default is 5.
	
	--hot-key=K		if the desired key K is pressed, start GRUB
				before booting PREVIOUS MBR. K is a word
				value, just as the value in AX register
				returned from int16/AH=1. The high byte is the
				scan code and the low byte is ASCII code. The
				default is 0x3920 for space bar. See "int 16
				keyboard scan codes" below.

	--floppy		if DEVICE_OR_FILE is floppy, use this option.

	--floppy=N		if DEVICE_OR_FILE is a partition on a hard
				drive, use this option. N is used to specify
				the partition number: 0,1,2 and 3 for the
				primary partitions, and 4,5,6,... for the
				logical partitions.

	--sectors-per-track=S	specifies sectors per track for --floppy.
				1 <= S <= 63, default is 63.

	--heads=H		specifies number of heads for --floppy.
				1 <= H <= 256, default is 255.

	--start-sector=B	specifies hidden sectors for --floppy=N.

	--total-sectors=C	specifies total sectors for --floppy.
				default is 0.

	--lba			use lba mode for --floppy. If the floppy BIOS
				has LBA support, you can specify --lba here.
				It is assumed that all floppy BIOSes have CHS
				support. So you would rather specify --chs.
				If neither --chs nor --lba is specified, then
				the LBA indicator(i.e., the third byte of the
				boot sector) will not be touched.

	--chs			use chs mode for --floppy. You should specify
				--chs if the floppy BIOS does not support LBA.
				We assume all floppy BIOSes have CHS support.
				So it is likely you want to specify --chs.
				If neither --chs nor --lba is specified, then
				the LBA indicator(i.e., the third byte of the
				boot sector) will not be touched.

	--fat12			FAT12 is allowed to be installed for --floppy.

	--fat16			FAT16 is allowed to be installed for --floppy.

	--fat32			FAT32 is allowed to be installed for --floppy.

	--vfat			FAT12/16/32 are allowed to be installed for
				--floppy.

	--ntfs			NTFS is allowed to be installed for --floppy.

	--ext2			EXT2 is allowed to be installed for --floppy.

	--install-partition=I	Install the boot record onto the boot area of
				partition number I of the specified hard drive
				or harddrive image DEVICE_OR_FILE.

DEVICE_OR_FILE:	Filename of the device or the image file. For DOS, a BIOS drive
number(hex 0xHH or decimal DDD) can be used to access the drive. BIOS drive
number 0 is for the first floppy, 1 is for the second floppy; 0x80 is for the
first hard drive, 0x81 is for the second hard drive, etc.

Note: BOOTLACE.COM writes only the boot code to MBR. The boot code needs to
load GRLDR as the second(and last) stage of the GRUB boot process. Therefore
GRLDR should be copied to the root directory of one of the supported
partitions, either before or after a successful execution of BOOTLACE.COM.
Currently only partitions with filesystem type of FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, NTFS,
EXT2 or EXT3 are supported.

Note 2: If DEVICE_OR_FILE is a harddisk device or a harddisk image file, it
must contain a valid partition table, otherwise, BOOTLACE.COM will fail. If
DEVICE_OR_FILE is a floppy device or a floppy image file, then it must contain
a supported filesystem(i.e., either of FAT12/FAT16/FAT32/NTFS/EXT2/EXT3).

Note 3: If DEVICE_OR_FILE is a floppy device or a floppy image file, and it
was formated EXT2/EXT3, then you should specify --sectors-per-track and
--heads explicitly.


Important!! If you install GRLDR Boot Record to a floppy or a partition, the
floppy or partition will boot solely grldr, and your original
IO.SYS(DOS/Win9x/Me) and NTLDR(WinNT/2K/XP) will become unbootable. This is
because the original boot record of the floppy or partition was overwritten.
There is no such problem when installing GRLDR Boot Record onto the MBR.
Update: Some NTLDR/IO.SYS/KERNEL.SYS files can be directly chainloaded in the
latest GRUB4DOS.

Tip: If the filename begins in a dash(-) or a digit, you may prefix a dirname
(./) or (.\) to it.

Examples:

	Installing GRLDR boot code to MBR under Linux:

		bootlace.com  /dev/hda

	Installing GRLDR boot code to MBR under DOS:

		bootlace.com  0x80

	Installing GRLDR boot code to a harddisk image under DOS or Linux:

		bootlace.com  hd.img

	Installing GRLDR boot code to floppy under Linux:

		bootlace.com  --floppy --chs /dev/fd0

	Installing GRLDR boot code to floppy under DOS:

		bootlace.com  --floppy --chs 0x00

	Installing GRLDR boot code to a floppy image under DOS or Linux:

		bootlace.com  --floppy --chs floppy.img

BOOTLACE.COM cannot function well under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003. It is expected
(and designed) to run under DOS/Win9x and Linux. Update: For image FILES,
bootlace.com function well under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003. For devices,
bootlace.com will not work under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 because bootlace.com
is a DOS utility and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 does not allow bootlace.com to
access devices.

Many people have contributed to this project. Thanks to everyone who posted feedback on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boot-land.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=5187">Grub4dos Guide</a> thread at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boot-land.net/forums/">boot-land</a>.

This guide is dedicated to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boot-land.net/forums/?showuser=2">Jaclaz</a>, without whose help it would not have been completed. As Jaclaz was responsible for getting me started with Grub4dos, I sent him my first draft with a request for his input. He replied by sending me a "few notes" (14 pages), with his permission they were incorporated into this guide. Jaclaz has also offered his help throughout - giving valuable input on a number of draft versions and proofing the final draft. In addition he has consistently supported Grub4dos users in a number of forums. Grazie Jaclaz.

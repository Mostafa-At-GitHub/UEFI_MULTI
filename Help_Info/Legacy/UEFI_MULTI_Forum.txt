UEFI Windows 8 + BIOS Grub4dos = MultiBoot USB-Harddisk

Everything At Once

Windows 8 came on computer with UEFI firmware and GPT partitioning of the internal harddisk.
On trying to boot with my existing USB-harddisk Or CD / DVD then initially Everything Failed.
UEFI does not like Grub4dos and so all boot Images failed. The boot CD's were not compatible with UEFI.

It was time to redesign USB Multiboot.

On computer with UEFI firmware I can Install Windows 8 on normal USB-harddisk having MBR and three primary partitions.
The first Boot partition E: is FAT32 Win8 Format and contains only the EFI folder
and the second partition M: is NTFS and filled by using WinNTSetup.
GPT partitioning is not needed and unwanted because it would only boot on UEFI firmware.

Install of Win 8 on USB using UEFI computer and latest beta version of WinNTSetup is OK 
Did not use any other tool. Boot and EFI folder are created on FAT32 partition.
http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/149612-winntsetup-v23/page__view__findpost__p__1022376

Manual procedure using Windows 8 Tools to make USB-harddisk bootable on UEFI computer:
Use Win 8 tools bootsect.exe to reset MBR bootcode and FAT32 PBR according to Win8
and use bcdboot.exe to create the EFI folder for booting Windows 8 from FAT32 partition.

bootsect.exe /nt60 E: /force /mbr
bcdboot.exe M:\Windows /s E: /f ALL

After Install of Win 8 then bcdedit.exe can be used to add Grub4dos entry in BootBCD for booting Image files.

Now I can boot from USB-harddisk on BIOS and on UEFI computers with Win8 (flat)
and with Grub4dos using all kind of Image files (Linux Parted Magic + LiveXP + 7PE + Portable XP + Win7)

Some Mobo e.g. Gigabyte GA-Z77MX-D3H allow to use F12 Boot Menu
and Select either BIOS or UEFI booting from USB-harddisk.

In my case BIOS Grub4dos booting Image files on UEFI computer is only possible
after switching in UEFI the Advanced OS setting from Win8 to Win7 / Other
For booting Windows 8 then the UEFI Advanced OS setting Win8 is used.

So now really Everything At Once is working.

From http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic=25262

At present I know that Windows 8 (flat) and Win 8 Recovery RAMDISK 
are booting OK from USB in UEFI Secure Boot by using Win8 efi\boot\bootx64.efi
and Linux Parted Magic is booting OK in UEFI > rEFInd > Grub2 , but only when Secure Boot is Disabled.

In UEFI-mode I cannot boot from USB  with Windows 7 or Other previous Windows System
In BIOS mode I support booting with Windows 7 and XP VHD's copied to NTFS Windows 8 System partition of USB-harddisk

The program UEFI_MULTI.exe can be used in Windows 7 Or Windows 8 OS.
Vista was not tested by me .....

XP OS is possible but then Win7 VHD Boot Menu entry and Win8 Boot Menu cannot be made.
In XP OS I can prepare MultiBoot USB-harddisk having Win8 Recovery RAMDISK UEFI Secure Boot support. :)
But in that case I must not use rEFInd and don't have Linux Parted Magic.

Interesting point is that NTLDR type or other Boot Sector Code is not used at all in UEFI mode,
since UEFI booting is using filename and test Secure Boot for efi\boot\bootx64.efi > bootmgr.efi > efi\Microsoft\Boot\BCD 
and that BCD has sources\boot.wim entry that uses boot\boot.sdi as ramdisksdipath

The above sequence is for RAMDISK booting using sources\boot.wim
but for booting Windows 8 from NTFS System partition of USB-harddisk then
UEFI booting is using filename and test Secure Boot for efi\boot\bootx64.efi followed by
> efi\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgr.efi > efi\Microsoft\Boot\BCD > path
efi\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi Firmware + boot.stl Certificate Trust List > \Windows\system32\winload.efi

In UEFI Secure Boot mode it is not so easy to boot something else as Certified Windows 8
In any case on my computer I cannot boot Windows 7 in UEFI mode.

Also WinNTSetup3 can be used after UEFI Secure Boot of Windows 8 or Win8 Recovery RAMDISK 
to prepare local harddisk drive for Install of any Windows using Windows Setup ISO file.

UEFI Multiboot USB - Windows 8 and Linux Parted Magic

UEFI Booting Linux Parted Magic involves two steps:
1. For UEFI Multiboot we use the refind EFI Boot Manager instead of the normal UEFI bootfile EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi
2. In EFI Boot Manager we use Grub2 and select Parted Magic from Grub2 Boot Menu

refind - EFI Boot Manager http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/

- download the latest binary zip file e.g. refind-bin-0.6.2.zip
- copy the content of refind folder to folder EFI\Boot of your USB FAT32 boot drive for Windows 8
- rename existng EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi as 8bootx64.efi for booting Windows 8
- copy file refind_x64.efi as file bootx64.efi  that is EFI Boot Manager in folder EFI\Boot
- add in folder EFI\Boot the supplied boot info files refind.conf and grub.cfg and Grub2 file grubx64.efi
- download latest Parted Magic ISO e.g. pmagic_2012_12_25.iso from http://partedmagic.com/doku.php?id=downloads
- copy the pmagic directory from the Parted Magic ISO to the root of your USB FAT32 Boot Partition
- menu entry for Parted Magic is in EFI\Boot\grub.cfg

Info see http://forums.partedmagic.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1960

Booting Parted Magic from USB goes like
- Boot and press Del to Enter BIOS - Disable SecureBoot - Save Settings with F10
- Reboot and just after beep press F8 or F12 to get BIOS Boot Menu
- UEFI USB > EFI Boot Manager file EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi > Grub2 EFI x64 file EFI\Boot\grubx64.efi > Grub2 Boot Menu

After booting with Windows 8 from USB you can run WinNTSetup3
and use R-mouse to mount Setup ISO and prepare drive for Install of Windows 7 or 8 or XP

In MultiBoot configurations Windows 8 quite often will set the NTFS dirty bit On for ALL local drives. 
Next boot then chkdsk will run on ALL local drives.

Setting of the NTFS dirty bit can be prevented with this registry tweak to Disable Hiberboot


Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

; Windows 8 Disable Hiberboot to prevent NTFS dirty bit in case of MultiBoot causing running of chkdsk

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Power]
"HiberbootEnabled"=dword:00000000

In case Windows 8 is unbootable then booting with an USB-stick with Windows Recovery Environment can be used to launch System Restore
by using Advanced Options and then use a Restore Point (if present) to restore Windows 8 system to an earlier state.

Such USB-stick Recovery Drive can be made from Configuration > Recovery Menu
For USB-stick everything works fine, but don't apply this to an existing multi-partition USB-harddisk.   

**** WARNING ****  
In case of USB-harddisk then creating the Recovery Drive will destroy the entire MBR
so that all other partitions are gone (the partition entries in the table are simply zeroed)
New MBR is created with one partition equal in size of the original first partition,
but with new alignment (Start Sector = 2048 instead of 63)

Fortunately I could repair my MBR of USB-harddisk to the original state by using TinyHexer and an earlier created MBR backup
so that my valuable DATA on the other partitions are accessible again, but the initial loss of the data partitions was quite a shock. 
Microsoft has forgotten that simply Formatting the drive of the first partition and may be adjusting the MBR bootcode would have been sufficient,
but instead they decided to repartition the entire USB-harddisk by creating the New MBR that they liked to use .....

ERUNT cannot be used in Windows 8 to Backup the Registry files.
Instead I am using now a handy utility that allows Backup and Restore of Windows 8 Registry files (e.g. default sam security system and software in folder system32\config)

Registry Backup
Tweaking.com - Registry Backup is a free backup tool that will use the Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service to backup your system registry.

http://www.tweaking.com/content/page/registry_backup.html



In Windows 8 use Configuration > Recovery to make Windows 8 Recovery USB-stick.
To save space and time you can Uncheck to Copy Recovery Partition (needed in case of Factory Restore)

It boots in UEFI Secure boot with Recovery Environment and with Advanced Options e.g. System Restore or Command prompt

Windows 8 Recovery ramdisk is as good (even better) than WinPE 4.0

In Recovery environment using command prompt, I can launch notepad and via File open get Explorer browser GUI
and can launch with R-mouse menu as administrator any 64-bits program e.g. WinNTSetup_x64.exe to Install any Windows version ......
by mounting with R-mouse any Windows Setup ISO file. 

I have made TBx64.exe AutoIt3 program and added to system32 in Win8 Recovery boot.wim
Remove winpeshl.ini and add modified startnet.cmd to launch TBx64.exe and Recovery Environment.

TBx64.exe will search for TBLauncher64.exe found e.g. in in root of USB-stick.
All Apps can be in root of USB-stick and launched from TBLauncher Menu.

On booting from USB-stick then Recovery environment appears auto with TBLauncher Menu.
One can launch e.g. WinNTSetup_x64.exe and prepare drive for install of any Windows e.g. XP

Download TBx64.exe from http://www.mediafire.com/#233dka636369k

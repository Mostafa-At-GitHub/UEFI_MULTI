How to Create Windows 8 x64 Recovery USB-stick

Create Windows 8 Recovery USB-stick for booting with boot.wim from RAMDISK (comparable to WinPE 4.0)

Computer OFF and Disconnect all USB-harddisks and connect USB-stick
Boot with Windows 8 x64
UEFI + BIOS bootable USB-stick with Win8 Recovery folder sources\boot.wim
is made with few mouseclicks in Win 8 Configuration > Recovery menu

For USB-stick everything works fine, but don't apply this to an existing multi-partition USB-harddisk.   

**** WARNING ****  
In case of USB-harddisk then creating the Win8 Recovery Drive will destroy the entire MBR
so that all other partitions are gone (the partition entries in the table are simply zeroed)
**** END WARNING ****  

Copy the content of Win8 Recovery USB-stick to folder UEFI_MULTI\W8_RECOV

I have made TBx64.exe AutoIt3 program and added to system32 in Win8 Recovery boot.wim
TBx64.exe will search for TBLauncher64.exe found e.g. in in root of USB Boot Drive
Some x64 Apps can be in root of USB Boot Drive and launched from TBLauncher Menu.
Modify TBLauncher.ini to your needs for Portable Apps that you want to Launch e.g. Explorer-x64.exe
On booting from USB then Recovery environment appears auto with TBLauncher Menu.
One can launch e.g. WinNTSetup2_x64.exe and prepare drive for install of any Windows e.g. XP

Download WinNTSetup2_x64.exe http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/149612-winntsetup-v23/

Microsoft calls the partition with the boot files the System partition, 
and the partition with the operating system the Boot partition. 
Everyone else refers to them exactly the other way round. 
The boot files on the boot partition. The operating system on the system partition.
